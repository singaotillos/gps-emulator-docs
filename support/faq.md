## General Questions

### What is a GPS Tracker Emulator?

A GPS tracker emulator is a software tool that **simulates real GPS tracking devices** without needing physical hardware. It sends GPS positions to tracking platforms just like a real device would.

### Why do I need this?

**Use cases:**
- üí∞ **Save money** - No need to buy expensive GPS hardware
- ‚ö° **Test faster** - Instant setup vs waiting for hardware
- üîß **Develop easier** - Perfect for app development
- üìä **Load testing** - Simulate 100+ devices simultaneously
- üéì **Learn** - Understand GPS protocols without investment

### Is this legal to use?

**Yes!** The emulator is for **legitimate testing and development purposes**:
- ‚úÖ Testing your GPS tracking application
- ‚úÖ Developing fleet management systems
- ‚úÖ Training and demonstrations
- ‚úÖ Quality assurance and QA testing
- ‚ùå NOT for spoofing real vehicle locations
- ‚ùå NOT for fraudulent purposes

### Can I create custom routes?

**Yes!** Three ways:
1. **Predefined routes** - Paris, London, NYC, Tokyo, Berlin
2. **Custom routes** - Define your own waypoints in config
3. **API** - Create routes programmatically via REST API

### Can I control devices in real-time?

**Yes!** via Web Interface or API:
- Start/Stop devices
- Change routes
- Modify speed
- Turn ignition on/off
- Send commands (protocol-dependent)

### Does it work offline?

**Yes**, for local testing:
- Emulator runs on localhost
- No internet needed for basic operation
- Internet needed only for remote Traccar connections

### Which protocol should I use?

**Popular choices:**
- **TK103** - Easy to start, widely compatible
- **OsmAnd** - Best for mobile apps
- **Teltonika** - Professional fleet management
- **GT06** - Very common, reliable

See PROTOCOLS.md for detailed comparison.

### Can I use multiple protocols at once?

**Yes!** Simulate different devices with different protocols simultaneously:
- 10 TK103 devices
- 5 GT06 devices
- 3 Teltonika devices
- All at the same time!

### Can I add my own custom protocol?

**Yes!** The system is extensible:
1. Source code included
2. Create new protocol in `protocols/` directory
3. Implement message format
4. Register protocol
5. Done!

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Port 5000 available?
   ```bash
   # Change port in .env if needed
   WEB_PORT=5001
   ```

### "Module not found" error

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

### Devices not sending data

**Check:**
1. Device status = "running"?
2. Correct protocol selected?
3. Correct port configured?
4. Firewall not blocking?

### Can't connect to Traccar

1. ‚úÖ Traccar server running?
2. ‚úÖ Device created in Traccar?
3. ‚úÖ Correct protocol in Traccar?
4. ‚úÖ Correct port (e.g., 5002 for TK103)?
5. ‚úÖ Firewall allows connection?

### Performance is slow

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce number of devices
2. Increase update interval in config
3. Use more powerful hardware
4. Close other applications

### Database locked error

**Solution:**
```bash
# Stop all instances
# Linux/Mac
pkill -f app.py

# Windows
taskkill /IM python.exe /F

# Remove lock file
rm /tmp/osmand_gps_emulator.lock
```
