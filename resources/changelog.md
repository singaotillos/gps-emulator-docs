## Upgrade Guide

### Upgrading from 1.x to 2.0

**Breaking Changes:**
- Configuration file format changed (YAML instead of JSON for some settings)
- API endpoints restructured (`/api/multidevice/*` instead of `/api/devices/*`)
- Database schema updated (automatic migration)

**Migration Steps:**

1. **Backup your data:**
   ```bash
   cp config.yaml config.yaml.backup
   cp vehicle_attributes.db vehicle_attributes.db.backup
   ```

2. **Install new version:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   ```

3. **Update configuration:**
   - Copy settings from old config to new config.yaml
   - Update API endpoints in your integration code

4. **Test before production:**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

5. **Restart application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

**New Features Available:**
- 36 additional protocols
- Enhanced web dashboard
- Monitoring system
- Plugin support (EE)
